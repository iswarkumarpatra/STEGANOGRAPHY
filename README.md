# Image Steganography using LSB Encoding

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of image steganography using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) encoding method.  It allows you to hide a text message within an image, providing a basic form of secure communication.

## Introduction

Steganography is the practice of concealing a message within another message or medium. In this project, we leverage the LSB technique to embed a secret message within the least significant bits of an image's pixel values. This makes the message imperceptible to the human eye.

## Problem Statement

The need for secure and discreet communication is ever-present. This project explores image steganography as a method to address this need, offering a solution for private data exchange.

## Technology Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used.
- **OpenCV (cv2):** A library for computer vision tasks, used for image processing.  Install with: `pip install opencv-python`
- **NumPy:** A library for numerical computing, used for array manipulation. Install with: `pip install numpy`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iswarkumarpatra/STEGANOGRAPHY.git
